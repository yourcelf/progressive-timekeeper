Progressive Timekeeper
======================

This is a simple application with which one can do "progressive timekeeping" â€“ keeping track of speaking time by categories of identity (e.g. sex, gender, racial identity, power position, etc). It can be used to help people think about whether or not speaking time in their organization's meetings are in fact equitable.

To use, set up the categories you'd like to track in the settings. Then, press the button when someone identifying with that category speaks, and press it again when they finish. Multiple categories can be activated at once. This app can run on a phone or laptop, and could be part of the role of a timekeeper, alongside facilitators or stack keepers.

Please send feedback, suggestions, or ideas to cfd@media.mit.edu or @cdetar.
